# List-of-past-work
This is a record of all of my past work that isn't included on here.

I did mantence work on this site as it has been online for quite some time. Most of the work that I did for the site was fixing up the tickets section https://www.madametussauds.com/london/en/tickets/. Prior to that, the tickets section did not work all that well on mobile, and on desktop there were a number of ticket designs. The work I did was all about getting a cohesive look for all tickets on the page, as well as fixing up the mobile layout. I also added a special events page, with a countdown timer, for when a upcoming event need advertising - currently not in use on the live site at this time. Finally I added a cookie notice to the site.

Here, we were tasked with transferring the design from madametussauds.com tickets over to this site. As you can see we made some modifications to what we previously did in order to match the visual style of the Shreks Adventure site. The design allows for expandable bullet points, to any desired length, by the use of a show more / less button.

On this site I was tasked with fixing up the design of the homepage so that ticket prices could be displayed clearly to the user. This layout was designed to work well on different screen sizes and uses several breakpoints in order to achieve this. A Vimeo or Youtube video can also be added to the page, again, breakpoints are used to make sure that the video both fits the screen while, at the same time, maintaining aspect ratio. Later on we had to go back and change some this around so that we could get auto playing videos to work again in Chrome, as Google disabled this behaviour in an update.     
I also added a image gallery to the site an, an example of which can be seen here https://www.londoneye.com/schools/

The design shown here is used on all naked juices sites for different languages and regions, in the different regions different products are sold and some features of the sites are different as a result. Because of this the design was made to be adaptive, the client can change around the layout of components or even totally remove sections that are not relevant without messing up the rest of the design. The design can adapt to different lengths of titles and even, although it is not currently used, can support right to left text as well.
